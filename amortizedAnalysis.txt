1. For the first 8 pushes, there are 8 units of cost. Then, the 9th push costs 9 units, totaling 17 units of cost for the first 9 pushes. We then fill the remaining 7 free spaces in the array, totaling 24 units of cost for 16 push operations. The 17th push operation costs 17 units due to the 2nd reallocation, totaling 41 units of cost. Similarly, there are 56 units of cost for 32 pushes, and 89 units of cost for 33 pushes. Finally, since there are no additional allocations required for the remaining 17 pushes, we get 106 total units of cost over 50 pushes.
